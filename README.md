## About

Hi! I am Darko. Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio. 

My experience in marketing has provided me with a deep understanding of how to leverage data to drive results. I have now decided to make of data analysis my job. I am eager to bring my unique perspective to a data-driven team and help organizations make better decisions with data.

This repository serves as a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

### When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?

**Code**: 

**Description**
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

**Skills** Joining datasets; Filter, group, and order data.
