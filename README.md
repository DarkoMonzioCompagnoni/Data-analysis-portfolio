# Darko Monzio Compagnoni - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi! I am Darko. Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio. 

My experience in social media management has provided me with a deep understanding of how to create effective campaigns and leverage data to drive results. However, I have realized my true passion lies in utilizing data to extract valuable insights and inform strategic decision-making. 

That's why I decided to transition my career into data analysis.

With my strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and ability to learn new technologies quickly, I am confident that I am well-suited to excel in this field. Learning and applying my learnings just comes naturally. 

I am eager to bring my unique perspective and skillset to a data-driven team and help organizations make better decisions with data.
