## About

Hi! I am Darko. Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio. This repository serves as a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

My experience in marketing has provided me with a deep understanding of how to leverage data to drive results. I am eager to bring my perspective to data-driven teams and help organizations make better decisions with data.

## Spreadsheets projects 

### Cryptocurrency portfolio analysis 

I created [this dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mAE5dSX0QiT_tyJR5I4a7vBkPESuCYhnAPyXO0oS-UM/edit?usp=sharing) from a 3500+ rows dataset of all transactions of 2022, downloaded from the crypto exchange platform [Nexo](https://nexo.io/). This dashboard is useful to track the value of a investment using the DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) technique. 

It's possible to read the amount of each owned coin, its real-time value, the amount paid, and the current value. The Earn/loss columns calculates the status of the investment. 

The doughnut charts show the coin allocation of the crypto portfolio and provide insights on whether and how to rebalance the portfolio allocation. Being the value of cryptocurrencies highly volatile, knowing if a coin is taking a *slice bigger than it should* tells it might be time to sell and profit. Currency can be changed between Euro and US Dollar, using the dropdown list in the top left-hand corner.

## SQL projects 

Find all the raw datasets[here](https://github.com/DarkoMonzioCompagnoni/datasets).

### When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

**Notebook:** [videogames_goldenage.ipynb](https://github.com/DarkoMonzioCompagnoni/Data-analysis-portfolio/blob/5b788befc09ee9ad40e90834532d5c9fca7967a0/videogames_goldenage.ipynb)

### American Baby Name Trends Analysis
In this project, I used data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes.

### Analyze International Debt Statistics
In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. 

**Notebook:** [international_debt.ipynb](https://github.com/DarkoMonzioCompagnoni/Data-analysis-portfolio/blob/28e203795f7da91761b900c0251ee29c659dcac7/international_debt.ipynb) 

### What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses
In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded and which industries they belong to.

The data is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I needed to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

## Qlik projects

### LinkedIn performance dashboard

I created this Qlik app starting from data downloaded from the [Productsup LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/productsup/), which I am admin of. Data were relative to the year 2022. Both sheets allow for the date range to be changed and update the charts automatically.

The first sheet, **LinkedIn dashboard**, shows the followers growth of the Productsup page and brand awareness metrics such as *Page views* and  *Impressions. From this sheeet, it's possible to see the number of followers by location, job function, industry, company size, and seniority. These audience insights not only tracked the page growth over time, but also helped improving the social media strategy in terms of messaging and posting time.

In the second sheet, **Post performance**, the focus moves from the audience to the posts published from the page. From the line chart, I learned that posting too frequently resulted in lower impressions for each post and adjusted the strategy accordingly. The bar charts at the bottom of the sheet give information on the type of media with the post and the average impressions for each type of media. 

Thanks to these insights, I could improve the LinkedIn strategy by prioritizing posts with videos and polls.
