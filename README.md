## About

Hi! I am Darko. Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio. This repository serves as a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

My experience in marketing has provided me with a deep understanding of how to leverage data to drive results. I am eager to bring my unique perspective to a data-driven team and help organizations make better decisions with data.

## Spreadsheets projects 

### Cryptocurrency portfolio analysis 
I created this dashboard from a 3500+ rows dataset of all transactions downloaded from the crypto exchange platform [Nexo](https://nexo.io/).
The dashboard allows to visualize the owned coins, the amount paid for them, and the current vale pulling live prices from the web.

It's also possible to select the currency between Euro and US Dollar using the dropdown list at the top.

## SQL projects 

### When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.
