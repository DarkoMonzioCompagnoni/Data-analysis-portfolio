## About

Hi! I am Darko. Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio. 

My experience in marketing has provided me with a deep understanding of how to leverage data to drive results. I have now decided to make of data analysis my job. I am eager to bring my unique perspective to a data-driven team and help organizations make better decisions with data.

This repository serves as a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.
