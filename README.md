# Darko Monzio Compagnoni - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi! I am Darko. Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio. This repository serves as a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.

My experience in marketing has provided me with a deep understanding of how to leverage data to drive results. I am eager to bring my perspective to data-driven teams and help organizations make better decisions with data.

Here's my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lx3Q6vZcyxcJU4NYulYl3BNuJZNsLLN3cVXksCO4pEM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Spreadsheets projects 

### Cryptocurrency portfolio analysis 

I designed [this dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mAE5dSX0QiT_tyJR5I4a7vBkPESuCYhnAPyXO0oS-UM/edit?usp=sharing) to track the value of my crypto investments using the DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) technique. It contains a 3500+ rows dataset of all transactions of 2022, downloaded from the crypto exchange platform [Nexo](https://nexo.io/). For each owned coin, I can track its amount and value, the real-time value of that coin, and the total amount paid for it. The Earn/Loss columns calculate the status of the investment.

The doughnut charts show the coin allocation of your crypto portfolio and can provide valuable insights on whether and how to rebalance the portfolio allocation. Knowing if a coin is taking a slice bigger than it should can help you decide if it might be time to sell and profit. The currency can also be changed between Euro and US Dollar with the dropdown list in the top left-hand corner.

### Optimizing online sports retail revenue
In this project I analyzed product data for an online sports retail company. I worked with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic. I used aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue.

### The Golden Age of video games
In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

### American baby names trends analysis
In this project, I used data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes.

### International debt statistics analysis 
In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.

### The World's oldest businesses analysis
In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded and which industries they belong to.

The data is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I needed to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

## Qlik projects

### LinkedIn performance dashboard

I created this Qlik using data from the [Productsup LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/productsup/), which I am the administrator of. The data was relative to the year 2022, and both sheets allow for the date range to be changed and have the charts automatically update accordingly.

The first sheet, the LinkedIn Dashboard, shows the followers growth of the Productsup page as well as various brand awareness metrics, such as *Page Views* and *Impressions*. This sheet reveals valuable insights about the page's followers, including their location, job function, industry, company size, and seniority. By tracking the page growth over time and analyzing the data, it becomes easier to strategize the messaging and timing of posts in order to maximize the page's reach and improve engagement.

In the second sheet, **Post Performance**, the focus shifts from the page followers to the posts published from the page. After studying the line chart, I realized that posting too frequently resulted in lower impressions for each post and quickly adjusted my strategy. The bar charts at the bottom of the sheet gave me the insight that posts with videos and polls received higher average impressions, which I leveraged to optimize the LinkedIn strategy. Not only did I reduce the frequency of posts, but I also made sure to include more videos and polls to maximize the post impressions.
